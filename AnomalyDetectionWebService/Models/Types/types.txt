Classes which in use to define types:

MODEL               => first defined in    MODEL.cs
CorrelatedFeatures  => first defined in    AnomalyDetection.cs
ExtendedModelInfo   => first defined in    IO_Utils.cs
Predict_Data        => first defined in    DATA.cs
Train_Data          => first defined in    DATA.cs
ANOMALY             => first defined in    ANOMALY.cs
Point               => first defined in    MathUtils.cs
Line                => first defined in    MathUtils.cs
Circle              => first defined in    MathUtils.cs
Counter             => first defined in    AnomalyDetectionController.cs
Span                => first defined in    AnomalyDetection.cs;  AnomalyDetectorsManager.cs; ANOMALY.cs;
								as ALIAS for List<long> which should contain exactly 2 elements:
								[start(inclusive), end(exclusive)]
